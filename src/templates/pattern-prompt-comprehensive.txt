Create a Strudel pattern for "{{song}}" by {{artist}}.

AUDIO ANALYSIS DATA:
{{analysisData}}

SONG STRUCTURE WITH TIMING:
{{songStructure}}

{{lyricsHint}}
{{sampleInfo}}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. TIMING & TEMPO:
   - Global BPM is {{bpm}}, but sections vary (see analysis)
   - Use .slow() to match the exact BPM: .slow({{bpm}}/120)
   - Adjust tempo per section when BPM changes significantly
   - Use the beat grid timing for precise rhythm placement

2. SECTION-SPECIFIC PATTERNS:
   - Each section MUST match its analyzed characteristics
   - Low energy sections: sparse patterns, fewer layers
   - High energy sections: full instrumentation, complex rhythms
   - Match onset density - more onsets = busier patterns

3. DYNAMIC PROGRESSION:
   - Volume should follow mean_volume analysis per section
   - Build from {{introEnergy}} energy intro to {{peakEnergy}} peak
   - Use filters and effects to match energy transitions

4. STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Create separate const variables for each section pattern
   - Use cat() or seq() to arrange the full song timeline
   - Ensure smooth transitions between sections
   - Total duration must be ~{{duration}} seconds

5. RHYTHM ACCURACY:
   - Use beat intervals from analysis for swing/groove
   - Place kicks/snares according to onset patterns
   - Maintain consistent timing with .cpm({{bpm}})

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
```
// Set global tempo
setcpm({{bpm}})

// Section patterns
const intro = // ... pattern for {{introStart}}s-{{introEnd}}s
const verse1 = // ... pattern for {{verse1Start}}s-{{verse1End}}s
const chorus1 = // ... pattern for {{chorus1Start}}s-{{chorus1End}}s
// ... more sections

// Full arrangement
const arrangement = cat([
  intro.slow(16),  // adjust for section duration
  verse1.slow(16),
  chorus1.slow(16),
  // ... complete timeline
])

// Play with effects
arrangement
  .room(0.5)
  .delay(0.125)
```

The pattern should:
- Match the analyzed BPM and energy levels exactly
- Use dynamics that follow the volume analysis
- Create rhythms based on onset patterns
- Build/release tension according to section energy
- Be a complete {{duration}}s arrangement

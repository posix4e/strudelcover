Create a Strudel pattern for "{{song}}" by {{artist}}.

{{songStructure}}

{{lyricsHint}}
{{sampleInfo}}
Instructions:
1. Follow the song structure timing closely - use .slow() or .fast() to match the BPM
2. Create distinct patterns for each section (intro, verse, chorus, etc.)
3. Use comments to mark each section clearly
4. Build energy progressively through the song
5. Include variations between repeated sections
6. Use Strudel's pattern sequencing to create the full song structure

The pattern should:
- Be a complete musical arrangement from intro to outro
- Capture the essence and style of the original song
- Use dynamics and effects to create emotional depth
- Include drums, bass, chords, melody, and atmospheric elements

Return ONLY the valid Strudel/JavaScript code that can be evaluated directly. Do not include any explanations or markdown formatting.
